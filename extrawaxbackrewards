Extra Wax-Back Rewards (EWBR) have been implemented as of June 2022! These rewards are from my personal wallet, and they are simply what they sound like: 
additional WAX rewards given to holders! Sometimes they may be exclusive to holders in the Discord server (so be sure to join!),
and other times they will be distributed across all holder wallets. When they are distributed,
they will be distributed evenly across the levels for each person, just like WBR.
Again, this is WAX coming from my personal wallet, typically from projects that I'm in. I like to share my earnings with collections holders too, though! 
Disclaimer: Since EWBR come from my personal wallet, I retain the right to withhold, change, distribute, and stop EWBR at any time. Standard WBR will never be affected by EWBR.  
The base percentages for EWBR are as follows (subject to change at any time):
Brilliance Level 1: 10%			Brilliance Level 2: 20%
Brilliance Level 3: 30%			Brilliance Level 4: 40% 

I'd like to point out that the EWBR distribution rates are essentially what the rates are for holders once the 25% WBR sales split has taken place. 
The 25% of sales is split amongst levels essentially identially to the EWBR system.
