Lhcnftsonwax will have multiple 'Series' within the entire collection, each titled something else, and containing totally different NFTs from the previous collections. The first series, Occulux, is going to be exclusively visual photography and art NFT's, taken/created and edited by me and my wife. These NFTs will have no special use case besides being blendable into different variants, as well as giving rewards back to the holders of them. There will be no need to actually stake your assets to receive WAX-Back Rewards, as there will (hopefully) be Smart Contracts written in to allow the holders of them to receive a percentage of sales without needing to be staked or taken out of your wallet in any way. 
The goal will be to allow those who hold their LHC NFTs to be able to passively earn WAX from the sales of the collection through both primary (directly from lhcnftsonwax) sales, and secondary market sales, without needing to do anything extra besides hold their NFTs in their wallets. There are plans to include many different Series' within the Collection, some of which will include user-submitted artwork that will allow artists to share even more of a percentage (50%?) of the sales with LHC, and this will also continue in perpetuity. 
As of July 2022, all LNOW NFTs from all series are stakeable on waxdao.io!
