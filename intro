Hello! I'm Matt, but most people call me Lumen! (full name: Lumenascent)
I'm the creator and owner of the NFT collection 'lhcnftsonwax'! I am the only developer that is working on this project (so far). This is the Lightpaper for the collection! I've added it to Github to try and keep a record of all changes made to the Lightpaper going forward, that way people can see for themselves what has changed when it's updated!
