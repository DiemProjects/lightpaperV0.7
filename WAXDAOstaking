All LNOW NFTs from all Series are stakeable on waxdao.io!
PLEASE read further before you jump over to waxdao and stake!!
This changes nothing about the WBR system, but adds an additional rewards system to the collection! 

With the addition of staking on waxdao also comes a choice: Do you stake your NFTs to earn LIGHT, or hold them to keep your Brilliance?

This is intentional!
When staking to waxdao, your NFTs are transferred from your wallet to the waxdaofarmer wallet, 
until you unstake them. This means that they will not count towards your Total Brilliance, and therefore can bring your WBR level down, 
even to zero (no WAX Back Rewards). 
This gives a bit of a strategic choice to holders, as they can choose to try to accumulate as much LIGHT as possible, 
keep their Brilliance high to get maximum WAX rewards back, or try to do a mix of both, staking low Brilliance NFTs and holding higher Brilliance ones! 
You can stake any of your LNOW NFTs for LIGHT on waxdao.io! To start, just head here -->   https://waxdao.io/farm/lhcnftsfarm 

Instructions on how to stake can be found on the Google Sheet (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gnQK2zCfYOU0DbiKO5tE_Yd4M_vLGz5f02FfgC3jq_0), 
as well as in the #staking-info channel in the Discord! Please feel free to ask any questions that you may have!
