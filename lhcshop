LIGHT has one use case as of 7/18/2022: To purchase LNOW NFTs from the lhcshop! 
As of 8/10/2022, the lhcshop contract deployment is indefinitely on hold. NFTHive.io allows us to sell LNOW NFTs on their site using LIGHT tokens (check out our collection page, and therefore has essentially negated the use of the lhcshop contract. 
The lhcshop.gm wallet has become the primary wallet used for the Lightkeeper bot in Discord. The below is being left to show what the hope for lhcshop was, and just in case it does come to fruition in the future.

The lhcshop is essentially of a copy of the Virtual Dream collection's thedreamshop, brought to you very generously by inostupid of Virtual Dream! 	This is a smart contract that is deployed from a wallet (lhcshop.gm), and allows you to send LIGHT directly to the shop wallet, along with the ID of the template that you want purchase, and the smart contract will initiate the transfers automatically! This will allow everyone to easily use their LIGHT that they have earned and held to purchase LNOW NFTs! Both NFTs that are available on Neftyblocks through drops will be available, as well as exclusive NFTs that only exist in the lhcshop! The launch date of the shop is TBD, but will hopefully be before the end of August 2022.
	Hopefully, this will bring some value to LIGHT due to the NFTs also having value in WAX, and also allow holders to start building up their LNOW collections for the future!
