The WAX-Back Rewards system will be based on your Total Brilliance (TB), which will be calculated from the total amount of lhcnftsonwax NFTs you have in your collection. My hope is to increase these percentages over time as the collection grows and matures, and hopefully I can get the percentage back from primary sales to 50% and secondary to 7-8% over time. My hope is for this to all happen in real-time through Smart Contracts, meaning that as soon as one NFT sells from either primary or secondary, the WAX will instantly be divided amongst all groups. If this isn't possible with Contracts, I will make specific roles for each group on Discord, and will tip out those roles in batches, likely at the end of each day. This is all tentative and subject to change, but it is my goal to make it all work out in this way, with these numbers or more.
The percentage that you get back will be split across all other users within that grouping. 
The percentages are as follows (subject to change at any time):
Primary Market Sales                           Secondary Market Sales
TB 1-25 = 2.5%					                       TB 1-25 =  0.5%
TB 26-50 = 5%                                  TB 26-50 =  1%
TB 51-75 = 7.5%					                       TB 51-75 = 1.5% 
TB 76-100+ = 10%                               TB 76-100 = 2%
Total = 25% out of 100%                        Total = 5% out of 10%

I do plan on adding new levels as the WBR system is reworked, but have still not completed it as of 8/18/22.
