[Personal Note From Lumenascent:] LNOW is a project that I personally believe has the ability to reach a great amount of people, 
and hopefully also be able to help all of those people grow together, with each other. The principles that have created LHC and LNOW are very important to me, 
and I strive to uphold them at all times with the collection, tokens, NFTs, and all other things that I do in the crypto/NFT space. 
My hope is that LNOW (and concurrently, LHC) will grow to be a well-known community within the WAX space, 
that people will regard highly as a project that cares about it's holders, the WAX space, and all things web3 in general, 
and that we show others that achieving greatness together is possible.
