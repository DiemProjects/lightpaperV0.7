	A game concept has been created and I'm in talks with a great coder who should be able to help the concept come to life! This will not be a typical P2E experience, as it will not be the primary focus of the collection, and it will not supersede the main ideas of LNOW that have been presented thus far. I have no intent or desire to create a full game experience for the collection, but I do have an idea for a type of mini-game that I would really like to see happen, and I think it would be a fun way to engage and reward holders who want to play it! But there will never be a penalty for not playing the game, and there will never be so many advantages to playing it that it becomes a "meta" for the collection in some way. I want it to be exactly as stated, a fun and engaging mini-game that holders can play, use some of their NFTs on, and hopefully earn some cool and unique rewards as well. 
	This concept also has the ability to be formed into a multi-player experience that could be ran using a DAO (or multiple smaller DAO-like groups), and decisions made in the game would effect all players within that group. This is not set in stone, but something that I also think would be a neat experience, and add even more value to LNOW as a whole.
[Personal Note From Lumenascent: LNOW is a project that I personally believe has the ability to reach a great amount of people, and hopefully also be able to help all of those people grow together, with each other. The principles that have created LHC and LNOW are very important to me, and I strive to uphold them at all times with the collection, tokens, NFTs, and all other things that I do in the crypto/NFT space. My hope is that LNOW (and concurrently, LHC) will grow to be a well-known community within the WAX space, that people will regard highly as a project that cares about it's holders, the WAX space, and all things web3 in general, and that we show others that achieving greatness together is possible.]
